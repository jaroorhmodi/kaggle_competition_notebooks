This notebook is part of my investigation for the [petals to the metal](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tpu-getting-started) competition.

This work involved studying multiple different pretrained CNN models, namely DenseNet201, Xception, VGG16, and EfficientNetB7. I chose the model with the best validation f-score, in this case it was **DenseNet201**.
The goal of participation in this project was to develop an understanding of how TPUs are used and to practice cross-validation and comparison of models using tensorflow packages.

This work is based on [Create Your First Submission](https://www.kaggle.com/ryanholbrook/create-your-first-submission) provided by Ryan Holbrook and  [Pretrained CNN Epic Fight ⚔️](https://www.kaggle.com/servietsky/pretrained-cnn-epic-fight) by Kaggle user Mehdi Gasmi.
